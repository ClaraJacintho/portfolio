                            <p>It is definitely my strongest area! I have studied it a lot in university, and have had the opportunity to apply the 
                                concepts in many different projects. I was also able to develop this set of skills in my previous internship at SAP, 
                                by building and maintaining HR software.</p>
                            <p> I am most familiar with Java, with C++ a near second, having worked with these languages for many projects in school, 
                                where I also used design patternsl. Also, since my current degree is in Computer Science and Management I have had the 
                                opportunity to study and to put in practice many of the facets of Project Management.

                            <p>Probably my two favourite areas! I have learnt a lot about them by myself, 
                            using resources found online, but I have also had some courses at my university, 
                            especially data science. More recently, I developed a machine learning/computer vision 
                            project for 2 months in partnership with Boise State University.</p>
                            <p>I have experience using Python, Keras and TensorFlow for machine learning and R for data science.

                            <p>My newest skill! While I am quite new to this part of the computer science world, 
                                I already love it. Being able to build something and share with friends and family 
                                is an incredible feeling! The only experience I have so far is this website and the projects 
                                and lessons on FreeCodeCamp, but I am already planning some new projects to continue to develop my abilities.</p>

                            <p>I am most familiar with JavaScript (React, react-bootstrap), HTML/CSS and GitHub pages.
